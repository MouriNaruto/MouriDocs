# MD28: Annual Review 2025 for Kenji Mouri

Here are some highlights of my activities and achievements:

## As a maintainer

In the second half of 2025, the NanaZip project is governed by multiple
Benevolent Dictators For Life who make final decisions by reaching an agreement
offline, which makes me feel less pressure as a single maintainer. I can focus
more on the things I love.

The NanaBox project also has some improvements which is useful for my daily use.
Also, helped me for some researches.

But I don't have enough time to work on NanaGet, which is unfortunate, maybe
the next year will have some changes.

Some infrastructure projects created and maintained by me are also improved, but
I don't think I should mention them here.

## As a contributor

With the help from [Yuhang Zhao], I started contributing to the Qt project in
2025, which submitted [some small patches] to improve the its build experience on
Windows with MSVC toolchain. I hope I can contribute more in the future.

I also made a merged commit to the ReactOS project to make that can build with
MSVC 14.50 toolchain in Visual Studio 2026, which will be helpful for people
want to use the latest MSVC toolchain to build ReactOS.

## As a college alumnus

I'm happy that I can help one of my juniors from college to improve his
technical skills and career development. Also, he helped me a lot, which not
only in verifying some of my career ideas which I provided to others, but also
in some of my researches like [Mile.Cirno].

I hope I can do some similar things in the future.

## As a researcher

Many guys know that one of my hobbies is researching guest interface internals
for Hyper-V. In 2025, I made several progresses in this area, including:

- Improved my Hyper-V guest interfaces definitions project called [Mile.HyperV]
  with more accurate definitions from existing Microsoft open source projects.
- Finally implemented Hyper-V Enhanced Session over VMBus for Linux guests,
  which is documented in [MD9: Hyper-V Enhanced Session over VMBus for
  pre-Windows 8.1 and Linux guests].

I also have some progresses in my operating system project called [Mobility],
which makes me feel less anxious about my life and goals.

## As a creator

When I was young, one of my R.I.P. friends told me that I should find another
hobby other than programming, or you will be tired of it one day. I had answered
to her that maybe creating light novels can be my another hobby. But I never
knew which topic I should write about.

In the second half of 2025, I finally knew the answer, which is writing a tensei
and isekai-style light novel. I hope I can finish writing the first volume in 
2028, which may be the revelation from the world administrator if actually
exists. Of course, my technical researches will be helpful for writing this.
So, the technical things I do now are not only for my career, but also for my
future.
